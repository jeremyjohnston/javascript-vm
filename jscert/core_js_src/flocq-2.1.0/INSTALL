Prerequisites
-------------

You will need the Coq proof assistant (>= 8.2) with a Reals theory
compiled in.

The .tar.gz file is distributed with a working set of configure files.
They are not in the SVN repository though. Consequently, if you are
building from SVN, you will need autoconf (>= 2.59) and automake (>= 1.8).


Configuring, compiling and installing
-------------------------------------

Ideally, you should just have to type:

  $ ./configure && make && make install

The environment variable "COQC" can be set to the Coq compiler command.
The configure script defaults to "coqc".

The option "--libdir=DIR" can be set to the directory where the compiled
library files should be installed by "make install". By default, the
target directory is "`$COQC -where`/user-contrib/Flocq".

The files are compiled at a logical location starting with "Flocq". This
default prefix can be removed with the "--disable-prefix" option.
