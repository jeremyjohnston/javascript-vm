JavaScript Virtual Machine in Coq
=================================

A project for CS6378 Language Based Security at UTDallas.

The goal is to implement a VM or extend an existing VM for
JavaScript in Coq. By transferring JavaScript semantics to Coq,
an automated theorem prover, we can then reason and prove things
about JavaScript Programs.

This would allow use to prove JS programs met some proof of
correctness and security.
